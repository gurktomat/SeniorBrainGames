      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Information can travel along neurons at speeds up to 268 mph (431 km/h). The speed varies depending on the type of neuron and whether it has a myelin sheath.",

      "options": ["Acetylcholine", "Serotonin", "Dopamine", "Glutamate"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Dopamine is often called the 'feel-good' neurotransmitter because it plays a key role in reward, motivation, and pleasure. It is also important for motor control and focus.",

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is when the brain is most active in consolidating memories, especially procedural and emotional memories. Deep sleep also helps with declarative memory consolidation.",

      "question": "What part of the brain controls the 'fight or flight' response?",
      "options": ["Prefrontal cortex", "Hippocampus", "Amygdala", "Cerebellum"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The amygdala is responsible for the fight-or-flight response and processing emotions, particularly fear. It can trigger rapid emotional reactions before the conscious brain has time to process information.",
