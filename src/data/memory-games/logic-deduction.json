      "question": "Tom is taller than Sue. Sue is taller than Mike. Who is the shortest?",
      "options": ["Tom", "Sue", "Mike", "They are all the same height"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since Tom is taller than Sue, and Sue is taller than Mike, Mike must be the shortest of the three.",

      "question": "A farmer has chickens and cows. He counts 8 heads and 22 legs in total. How many cows does he have?",
      "options": ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "8 heads means 8 animals total. If all 8 were chickens, that would be 16 legs. Each cow adds 2 extra legs (4 instead of 2). We need 22 - 16 = 6 extra legs, so 6 ÷ 2 = 3 cows (and 5 chickens). Check: 3 × 4 + 5 × 2 = 12 + 10 = 22 legs.",

      "options": ["108", "162", "72", "216"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Each number is multiplied by 3 to get the next: 2 × 3 = 6, 6 × 3 = 18, 18 × 3 = 54, so 54 × 3 = 162.",

      "options": ["Amy, Carl, Ben", "Amy, Ben, Carl", "Carl, Amy, Ben", "Ben, Amy, Carl"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Ben finished after Amy, so Amy was ahead of Ben. Carl did not finish first, so Amy must be first. Amy did not finish last (confirmed — she's first). Ben finished after Amy, and Carl was not first, so the order is Amy (1st), Carl (2nd), Ben (3rd).",

      "options": ["All roses fade quickly", "Some roses fade quickly", "No roses fade quickly", "None of these must be true"],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "We know all roses are flowers, and some flowers fade quickly — but we cannot be certain that any of those quickly-fading flowers are roses. It is possible, but not guaranteed. Therefore, none of the first three statements must be true.",

      "options": ["0 degrees", "7.5 degrees", "15 degrees", "90 degrees"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "At 3:15, the minute hand points at the 3 (90 degrees from 12). But the hour hand has moved past the 3 by a quarter of the way toward the 4. Each hour mark is 30 degrees, so a quarter is 7.5 degrees. The angle between them is 7.5 degrees.",

      "question": "You have three boxes: one has only apples, one has only oranges, and one has both. All three labels are WRONG. You pick one fruit from the box labeled 'Apples and Oranges' and it's an apple. What does the box labeled 'Oranges' actually contain?",
      "options": ["Oranges", "Apples", "Apples and Oranges", "It could be either"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since all labels are wrong, the box labeled 'Apples and Oranges' cannot have both — and you drew an apple, so it must be the 'only apples' box. The box labeled 'Oranges' is also mislabeled, so it cannot contain only oranges. It cannot be apples (that's the box we just identified). So it must contain apples and oranges.",

      "options": ["First place", "Second place", "Third place", "It depends on the race"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "If you overtake the person in second place, you take their position — you are now in second place. You did NOT overtake the person in first place, so you are not in first.",

You turn switch 1 on for 10 minutes, turn it off, then turn switch 2 on, and enter. The bulb that is on is controlled by which switch?",
      "options": ["Switch 1", "Switch 2", "Switch 3", "Cannot be determined"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Switch 2 is currently on, so the lit bulb is controlled by switch 2. The bulb that is off but warm to the touch is controlled by switch 1 (it was on for 10 minutes). The bulb that is off and cold is controlled by switch 3.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "You take the first pill immediately (time 0). You take the second pill 30 minutes later. You take the third pill 30 minutes after that. Total time: 60 minutes, not 90.",

      "options": ["17 minutes", "19 minutes", "21 minutes", "15 minutes"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The optimal strategy: (1) 1-min and 2-min cross together (2 min). (2) 1-min returns with flashlight (1 min). (3) 5-min and 10-min cross together (10 min). (4) 2-min returns with flashlight (2 min). (5) 1-min and 2-min cross together (2 min). Total: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.",

      "options": ["2", "3", "4", "6"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Divide the 12 coins into three groups of 4. Weigh group 1 vs group 2. If they balance, the fake is in group 3. If not, take the lighter group. Now divide the 4 suspect coins into groups: weigh 1 vs 1 from 2 of them. One more weighing identifies the fake. Three weighings are always enough.",
