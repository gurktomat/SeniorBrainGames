        "A wall designed to resist lateral forces like wind and earthquakes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "A shear wall is a structural element designed to resist lateral forces such as wind and earthquake loads. Made of reinforced concrete or braced steel, shear walls prevent buildings from swaying or collapsing during lateral loading.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "engineering"
    },
    {
      "id": "structural-engineering-quiz-14",
      "question": "The I-beam (also called H-beam) is one of the most common structural steel shapes. Why is it so efficient?",
      "options": [
        "Most of the material is concentrated where bending stress is highest",
        "It uses the least material",
        "It is the easiest to manufacture",
        "It looks aesthetically pleasing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The I-beam shape is efficient because it concentrates most of its material in the flanges (top and bottom), which is where bending stresses are greatest. The thin web in the middle provides shear resistance with minimal material.",
