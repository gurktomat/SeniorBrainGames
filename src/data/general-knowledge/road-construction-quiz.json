      "options": [
        "10,000 miles",
        "30,000 miles",
        "80,000 miles",

        "John Loudon McAdam",
        "James Watt",
        "John Rennie",
        "Thomas Telford"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "John Loudon McAdam developed the macadamization technique around 1820, using layers of progressively smaller broken stones that were compacted by traffic. This provided a durable, well-drained road surface far superior to previous methods.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The statumen was the bottom foundation layer of a Roman road, consisting of large flat stones. Above it came the rudus (rubble), nucleus (gravel and sand), and summum dorsum (the paved surface of fitted stones).",

        "It was the first to use mortar",
        "It was built in a straight line regardless of terrain",
        "It had separate lanes for traffic",
        "It included bridges for rivers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Appian Way was revolutionary because it was engineered to run as straight as possible, cutting through hills and filling in valleys rather than following the natural terrain. This set the standard for Roman road engineering.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A road camber or crown is the slight curve of the road surface, higher in the center and sloping to the edges. This design causes rainwater to drain off the road to the sides, preventing water from pooling on the surface.",

        "Frozen water expanding underground and pushing the road surface upward",
        "Ice forming on the road surface"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Frost heave occurs when water in the soil beneath a road freezes and expands, pushing the road surface upward unevenly. When the ice melts, the weakened soil causes the road to crack and develop potholes.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Rumble strips are grooves or raised patterns on road shoulders or center lines that create vibration and noise when a vehicle's tires roll over them, alerting drowsy or inattentive drivers that they are drifting out of their lane.",
