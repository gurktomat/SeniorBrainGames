      "options": ["Sea geysers", "Black smokers", "Ocean volcanoes", "Deep bubblers"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hydrothermal vents are often called black smokers because they emit dark plumes of superheated, mineral-rich water that looks like black smoke. They can reach temperatures above 700°F (370°C).",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ocean tides are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun on Earth's oceans. The Moon's proximity to Earth makes it the dominant tidal force.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the water pressure is over 15,000 pounds per square inch — more than 1,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Deep-sea organisms have adapted to withstand this crushing force.",
