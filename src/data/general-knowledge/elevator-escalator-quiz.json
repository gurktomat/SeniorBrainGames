      "question": "Who demonstrated the first safety elevator at the Crystal Palace exhibition in New York in 1854?",
      "options": [
        "Thomas Edison",
        "Elisha Otis",
        "Alexander Graham Bell",
        "Nikola Tesla"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Elisha Otis demonstrated his safety elevator at the Crystal Palace in 1854, standing on a platform and having the rope cut to show his safety mechanism would prevent a fall. This made tall buildings practical for the first time.",

      "id": "elevator-escalator-quiz-2",
      "question": "What was the revolutionary safety feature of Elisha Otis's elevator?",
      "options": [
        "An automatic brake that engaged if the cable broke",
        "A backup cable system",
        "A padded floor",
        "An emergency bell"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Otis's safety mechanism used a spring-loaded device with teeth that engaged ratchet bars on the guide rails if the hoisting rope broke, immediately stopping the elevator from falling. This was the key innovation enabling modern elevators.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Burj Khalifa's elevators travel at 10 meters per second (36 km/h or 22 mph), taking about 60 seconds to reach the observation deck on the 124th floor. Even faster elevators exist in other buildings, such as the Shanghai Tower.",

        "An elevator for clergy",
        "A continuously moving chain of open compartments that riders step on and off"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "A paternoster is a continuously moving chain of open compartments (without doors) that travel in a loop. Riders step on and off at each floor. Named after the rosary prayer beads they resemble, most have been phased out for safety reasons.",

        "Balancing the weight of the car and passengers to reduce motor effort",
        "Emergency braking",
        "Providing backup power"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The counterweight, typically weighing the same as the car plus 40% of its maximum passenger load, balances the system so the motor only needs to move the difference in weight. This dramatically reduces energy consumption.",

        "Serving two buildings",
        "Moving twice as fast"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Double-deck elevators have two cabins stacked vertically in the same shaft, with one serving odd-numbered floors and the other serving even-numbered floors simultaneously. This doubles capacity without needing additional shafts.",

      "options": [
        "To generate electricity",
        "To clean shoes",
        "Decoration",
        "To prevent objects from getting caught in the gap between steps and landing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Comb plates have interlocking teeth that mesh with grooves in the escalator steps to prevent objects (clothing, shoelaces, fingers) from getting trapped in the gap between the moving steps and the stationary landing.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A sky lobby is an intermediate floor in a skyscraper where passengers transfer from express elevators to local elevators serving a specific zone of floors. This reduces the number of elevator shafts needed, freeing up valuable floor space.",

        "Steam power",
        "Manual winch"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower's original elevators used hydraulic power to operate. The tower has had various elevator systems since 1889, with modern upgrades, but the principle of hydraulic lift has been maintained for some of the historic elevators.",

      "options": [
        "Passengers select their floor before entering, and are grouped efficiently",
        "Transparent elevator walls",
        "Faster doors",
        "Voice-activated controls"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Destination dispatch has passengers enter their desired floor on a keypad in the lobby before boarding. The system groups passengers going to similar floors into the same elevator, reducing stops and wait times by up to 30%.",
