      "question": "Which famous inventor championed direct current (DC) power distribution in the 'War of Currents'?",
      "options": [
        "Alexander Graham Bell",
        "Thomas Edison",
        "Nikola Tesla",
        "George Westinghouse"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Thomas Edison championed direct current (DC) power distribution in the late 1880s 'War of Currents' against Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, who promoted alternating current (AC). AC ultimately won due to its ability to be transmitted over long distances.",

    {
      "id": "power-grid-quiz-2",
      "question": "Why did alternating current (AC) win over direct current (DC) for power distribution?",
      "options": [
        "AC is safer",
        "AC voltage can be easily transformed for efficient long-distance transmission",
        "AC is cheaper to generate",
        "DC was patented and too expensive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "AC won because transformers can easily step up AC voltage for efficient long-distance transmission (reducing energy loss) and step it down for safe household use. DC could not be easily transformed with the technology of the era.",
