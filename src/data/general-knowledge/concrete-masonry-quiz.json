      "options": [
        "Pumice",
        "Calcite",
        "Pozzolana",
        "Calcium oxide"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Roman concrete (opus caementicium) used pozzolana, volcanic ash from the area near Pozzuoli. Mixed with lime and seawater, it created a concrete so durable that Roman structures like the Pantheon still stand today after 2,000 years.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Concrete contains cement, water, sand, and coarse aggregate (gravel or crushed stone), while mortar contains only cement, water, and fine sand. Mortar is used as a bonding agent between bricks or stones, not as a structural material.",

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The mortar used in sections of the Great Wall contained sticky rice (glutinous rice) flour mixed with calcium carbonate. The amylopectin in sticky rice made the mortar stronger and more water-resistant than plain lime mortar.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Curing is the process of maintaining adequate moisture, temperature, and time to allow concrete to reach its desired strength. Proper curing is essential because the chemical reaction (hydration) between cement and water needs water to continue.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Self-healing concrete contains bacteria spores or microcapsules of healing agents that are activated when cracks form and water enters. The bacteria produce limestone that fills the cracks, or the capsules release adhesive, extending the concrete's lifespan.",
