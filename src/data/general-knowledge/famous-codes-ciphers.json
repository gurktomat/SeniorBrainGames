      "question": "What was the name of the German encryption machine that the Allies famously cracked during World War II?",
      "options": ["SIGABA", "Enigma", "Lorenz", "Purple"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Enigma machine was used by Nazi Germany to encrypt military communications. Breaking the Enigma code at Bletchley Park is estimated to have shortened the war by at least two years.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The scytale was used by the ancient Spartans for military communication. A strip of leather was wrapped around a wooden rod of specific diameter, and the message was written across the wound leather. Only someone with a rod of the same size could read it.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within something that appears ordinary, such as invisible ink on a letter, or hidden data within a digital image. Unlike encryption, the goal is to hide the existence of the message itself.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In cryptography, plaintext refers to the original readable message before encryption. Once encrypted, it becomes 'ciphertext.' The process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext is called decryption.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mary used a nomenclator cipher (substitution with some code words), but it was cracked by Elizabeth I's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham's codebreaker. Frequency analysis of the simple substitution elements revealed her treasonous correspondence.",
