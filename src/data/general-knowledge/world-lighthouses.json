      "options": ["Candles and oil lamps", "Gas lanterns only", "Reflected sunlight", "Phosphorescent minerals"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Early lighthouses used open fires, candles, and oil lamps as light sources. The light was amplified using mirrors and later Fresnel lenses. Whale oil, kerosene, and eventually gas were used before electrification.",
