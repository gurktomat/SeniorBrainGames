      "id": "esci-1",
      "question": "Why does ice float on water?",
      "options": [
        "Ice contains air bubbles",
        "Ice is a different substance than water",
        "Cold things always float",
        "Ice is less dense than liquid water"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Water expands when it freezes, making ice less dense than liquid water. This is why ice floats — a unique property that insulates lakes in winter.",

    },
    {
      "id": "esci-2",
      "question": "What causes bread to rise when baking?",
      "options": [
        "Yeast producing carbon dioxide gas",
        "Heat from the oven",
        "Butter melting inside",
        "Flour absorbing water"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Yeast ferments sugars in the dough, producing carbon dioxide gas. These gas bubbles get trapped in the gluten network, causing the bread to rise.",

    },
    {
      "id": "esci-3",
      "question": "Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon at the same temperature?",
      "options": [
        "Metal is actually colder",
        "Metal conducts heat away from your hand faster",
        "It's just an illusion",
        "Wood stores more warmth"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Metal is a much better heat conductor than wood. It pulls heat away from your warm hand more quickly, making it feel colder even though both are the same temperature.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-4",

        "Blue light is scattered more by the atmosphere"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Sunlight is scattered by molecules in the atmosphere, and shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more than other colors — this is called Rayleigh scattering.",

        "They release a sulfur-based gas that reacts with your tears"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Cutting onions releases syn-propanethial-S-oxide, a sulfur compound that reacts with the moisture in your eyes to form a mild sulfuric acid, triggering tears.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-6",

    },
    {
      "id": "esci-8",

        "Clouds colliding with each other"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Lightning heats the surrounding air to about 30,000 Kelvin. This rapid heating causes the air to expand explosively, creating the sound waves we hear as thunder.",

        "Mirrors only work horizontally",
        "Light bends differently vertically"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A mirror actually reverses front and back (depth), not left and right. We perceive it as a left-right reversal because we imagine turning around to face ourselves.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-10",

        "Lightning happens before thunder",
        "Light travels much faster than sound",
        "Our eyes process faster than our ears"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Light travels at about 186,000 miles per second, while sound travels at only about 1,100 feet per second. So we see the flash almost instantly but the sound takes longer to reach us.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "category": "science"
    },

        "The Moon's own momentum",
        "Earth's magnetic field"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Earth's gravitational pull keeps the Moon in orbit. The Moon is constantly 'falling' toward Earth, but its forward motion keeps it in a stable orbit.",

        "Evaporation draws heat away from your body",
        "Water is always cold"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When water evaporates from the wet shirt, it absorbs heat energy from your skin. This evaporative cooling makes you feel colder.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-13",

        "Frost damages the green color"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "As days shorten, trees stop producing green chlorophyll. This reveals yellow and orange pigments (carotenoids) that were always present but masked by the green.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-14",

        "Hydrogen",
        "Nitrogen"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Nitrogen makes up about 78% of Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen is second at about 21%. Despite being essential, oxygen is not the most abundant gas.",

      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-15",
      "question": "Why does hot water sometimes freeze faster than cold water?",
      "options": [
        "This never actually happens",
        "It's called the Mpemba effect and isn't fully understood",
        "Hot water has less dissolved gas",
        "The container warms the freezer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Mpemba effect is a real phenomenon where hot water can freeze faster than cold water under certain conditions. Scientists still debate the exact cause.",

    {
      "id": "esci-16",
      "question": "What makes soap effective at cleaning?",
      "options": [
        "It kills all bacteria",
        "It's acidic and dissolves dirt",

        "Its molecules attract both water and oil"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Soap molecules have one end that attracts water and another that attracts oil and grease. This allows soap to lift oily dirt from surfaces and wash it away with water.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-17",
      "question": "Why do stars appear to twinkle?",

        "Stars actually pulse with light",
        "Earth's atmosphere bends their light"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Starlight passes through layers of Earth's atmosphere with different temperatures and densities, causing the light to bend and shift — creating the twinkling effect.",

      "category": "science"
    },
    {
      "id": "esci-18",

        "Gyroscopic effect from angular momentum"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "A spinning top stays upright due to the gyroscopic effect. Its angular momentum resists changes to its orientation, keeping the axis stable.",

        "The North Pole has more iron"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A compass needle is a small magnet that aligns with Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by convection currents in the planet's molten iron outer core.",
