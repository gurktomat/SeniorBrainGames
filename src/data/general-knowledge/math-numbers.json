      "id": "mn-1",
      "question": "What is the only number that is both a prime number and an even number?",
      "options": ["0", "1", "2", "4"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "2 is the only even prime number. Every other even number is divisible by 2, so they can't be prime."
    },

      "options": ["4", "6", "8", "10"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "6 is a perfect number because its divisors (1, 2, and 3) add up to 6. The next perfect number is 28."
    },
    {
      "id": "mn-9",
      "question": "What is the mathematical term for a triangle with all three sides of equal length?",
      "options": ["Isosceles", "Scalene", "Equilateral", "Right"],

      "options": ["25%", "33%", "50%", "75%"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The probability is 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4, or 25%. Each flip is independent with a 50% chance of heads."
    },
    {
      "id": "mn-11",
      "question": "What is the sum of all angles inside a triangle?",
      "options": ["90 degrees", "180 degrees", "270 degrees", "360 degrees"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The angles inside any triangle always add up to exactly 180 degrees, regardless of the triangle's shape."

      "id": "mn-13",
      "question": "What is 15% of 200?",
      "options": ["15", "25", "30", "35"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "15% of 200 = 0.15 × 200 = 30. A quick way: 10% is 20, and 5% is 10, so 15% = 30."

      "options": ["The golden ratio", "The 3-4-5 triangle", "Calculus", "Algebra"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Egyptians used ropes knotted in a 3-4-5 ratio to create perfect right angles, based on the Pythagorean theorem."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Each fold doubles the thickness. After 42 folds, the paper would be about 440,000 km thick — enough to reach the Moon!"
