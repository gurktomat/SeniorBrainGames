      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An anchor is a heavy device, typically made of metal, that is lowered to the sea floor to hold a ship in a fixed position. Anchors grip the bottom through their weight and design, preventing the vessel from drifting.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A bulkhead is a vertical wall or partition inside a ship that divides the hull into separate compartments. Bulkheads strengthen the ship's structure and, importantly, can contain flooding—if one compartment is breached, the bulkheads prevent water from filling the entire vessel.",
