    {
      "id": "fig-1",
      "question": "What figure of speech is used in: 'She is as brave as a lion'?",
      "options": [
        "Personification",
        "Simile",
        "Metaphor",
        "Hyperbole"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A simile compares two things using 'as' or 'like.' Here, her bravery is compared to a lion's using 'as.'",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-2",
      "question": "What figure of speech is used in: 'Time is money'?",
      "options": [
        "Simile",
        "Irony",
        "Metaphor",
        "Hyperbole"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A metaphor directly states that one thing IS another without using 'like' or 'as.' Time is compared to money directly.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-3",
      "question": "What figure of speech is used in: 'I've told you a million times'?",
      "options": [
        "Simile",
        "Understatement",
        "Metaphor",
        "Hyperbole"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Hyperbole is deliberate and obvious exaggeration for emphasis. No one has literally said something a million times.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-4",
      "question": "What figure of speech is used in: 'The wind whispered through the trees'?",
      "options": [
        "Simile",
        "Personification",
        "Oxymoron",
        "Pun"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Personification gives human qualities to non-human things. Wind cannot literally whisper — that is a human action.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-5",
      "question": "Which of these is an example of onomatopoeia?",
      "options": [
        "The cat went hiss and scratch",
        "Life is a journey",
        "The stars danced in the sky",
        "Jumbo shrimp"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Onomatopoeia is a word that imitates the natural sound it describes. 'Hiss' and 'scratch' mimic actual sounds.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-6",
      "question": "Which of these is an example of alliteration?",
      "options": [
        "She sells seashells by the seashore",
        "Break a leg",
        "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times",
        "The plot thickens"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Alliteration is the repetition of the same initial consonant sound in nearby words. 'She sells seashells by the seashore' repeats the 's' and 'sh' sounds.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-7",
      "question": "What figure of speech is 'deafening silence'?",
      "options": [
        "Oxymoron",
        "Hyperbole",
        "Simile",
        "Alliteration"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "An oxymoron combines two contradictory terms. Silence cannot literally be deafening, creating a striking contradiction.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-8",
      "question": "A fire station burns down. What figure of speech does this situation represent?",
      "options": [
        "Irony",
        "Personification",
        "Metaphor",
        "Hyperbole"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Irony involves a contrast between expectation and reality. A fire station is meant to fight fires, so it burning down is deeply ironic.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-9",
      "question": "What figure of speech is 'break a leg' (meaning good luck)?",
      "options": [
        "Hyperbole",
        "Idiom",
        "Oxymoron",
        "Simile"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An idiom is a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from the literal definitions of its words. 'Break a leg' means good luck in theater.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-10",
      "question": "What figure of speech is used in: 'He passed away last night' instead of 'He died'?",
      "options": [
        "Simile",
        "Euphemism",
        "Metaphor",
        "Irony"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A euphemism is a mild or indirect expression used in place of one considered too harsh or blunt. 'Passed away' softens the concept of death.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-11",
      "question": "What figure of speech is used in: 'I'm so hungry I could eat a horse'?",
      "options": [
        "Simile",
        "Personification",
        "Metaphor",
        "Hyperbole"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "This is hyperbole — an extreme exaggeration used for emphasis. The speaker is very hungry but could not literally eat an entire horse.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-12",
      "question": "Which of these is an example of a pun?",
      "options": [
        "The thunder roared",
        "He was as cold as ice",
        "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana",
        "The world is a stage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A pun is a play on words that exploits multiple meanings. 'Flies' is used as both a verb (to fly) and a noun (the insect), and 'like' shifts from 'similar to' to 'enjoy.'",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-13",
      "question": "What figure of speech is used in: 'Love is like a battlefield'?",
      "options": [
        "Metaphor",
        "Euphemism",
        "Personification",
        "Analogy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "An analogy is an extended comparison that explains an unfamiliar concept by relating it to a familiar one. Comparing love to a battlefield draws an analogy between the two experiences.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-14",
      "question": "What figure of speech is: 'It's just a scratch' (said about a large dent in a car)?",
      "options": [
        "Euphemism",
        "Hyperbole",
        "Irony",
        "Understatement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Understatement deliberately makes something seem less important or serious than it really is. Calling a large dent 'just a scratch' downplays the damage.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "category": "language"
    },
    {
      "id": "fig-15",
      "question": "What figure of speech is: 'Can't you do anything right?'",
      "options": [
        "Rhetorical question",
        "Irony",
        "Pun",
        "Cliche"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A rhetorical question is asked for effect, not to get an answer. The speaker is expressing frustration, not genuinely asking for information.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "category": "language"
    }
  ]
